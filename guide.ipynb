No use the gradio backend API, instead create a full backend to serve the model output: Right now we have two services, one for the front and another one for the back, even the front service has a lot of improvement in terms of architecture it's enough in order to have all running. But having a full backed service that could be fully in charge of the model serving will give us more control about what we can do with the model output and the inputs we will be sended to the model, also can help us to think on the data infrastructure and architecture because right now we are just storing images and audio without any context.t2. have a database: with a database we can store the payloads sended to the model, also more information about users that could be used as a ladder for BI or stronger analysis in how to improve the product. 3. Use hugging face workspace to use the models from there: Right now we are using a model in the local machine, this model uses a gpu in case of having one available or the CPU this is very expensive, we can use a tool like hugging face to check for another models that actually do the same thing less expensive or use the workspace they provide as main computational hub for the inference endpointsce endpoints "
